# Sense Lang

**Sense** is a [VHLL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high-level_programming_language) (very high level lang.), [FP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) (functional programming) language that builds a layer of abstraction above the industry standard general purpose programming languages _(like Java, Kotlin, Kotlin, Swift, JS, Python)_ with the purpose to **create software without caring about implementation details.**

> "Programming is a game of information and logic, not of libraries, frameworks and terminology."\

## Motivation

Sense purpose is to create software fast and express domain (business) logic by providing only the 100% necessary information and not a single line above that. Meaning that when you're writing Sense you won't care about:
- ~~boilerplate code~~
- ~~complex design patterns~~
- ~~libraries & frameworks~~
- ~~threading~~

> Programming in Sense should be about **thinking** and **expressing** your logic freely in a concise type-safe and functional way.

**Benefits**
- **Easy to learn:** minimal and simple syntax.
- **Focus only on what matters:** write domain logic and algorithms only.
- **Platform agnostic:** Android, iOS, Web, Desktop, Backend
- **Frameworks/libraries agnostic:** you can target which libs/frameworks you want and the Sense Compiler will generate the code for you.

**Tradeoffs**
- **Performance:** such high-level of abstraction certainly comes with some efficiency costs.
- **:warning: Experimental:** _WIP to be developed._
- **No adoption & community:** if Sense makes sense maybe one day millions of devs would use it.

> Sense Lang: correctness, simplicity, and convenience **over** efficiency, low-level control and implementation details.

**"Sense" name meaning:**
- _"sense"_ like a purpose
- _"sense"_ like a feeling
- _"sense"_ like make sense
